# OCR

This project implements OCR for the first 10 pages of a general PDF. This program will be compatiable with SQL databases. Currently the `testing.ipynb` file has functionality up to scanning the first ten pages of `example.pdf` and processing the scanned results into images that box and show what was scanned.

I plan to clean up and improve functionality of code next. I also plan to incorporate funcrionality with SQL databases down the line.
